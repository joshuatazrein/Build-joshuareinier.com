I identify a similar process used by both Gilman and Ferrante in which the female protagonist reinvents herself as a \u201Cnewly born woman,\u201D which I outline in three stages. First, the subject somatizes patriarchy, percieving it with spatial metaphors and thus representing it in a nonverbal, non-rational way. Second, she encodes a hallucination of oppressed femininity within the patriarchal space, exploring her oppression and potential liberation through a progressively more real \u201Calter ego.\u201D This culminates in the protagonist blending her physical self with her hallucinated alter ego, claiming a new agency just as she appears to be claimed by hysteria.
